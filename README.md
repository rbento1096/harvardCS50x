# harvardCS50x
Course content for Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x).

Week 0 -> Introduction to basic concepts using Scratch
I made a small game consisting on dribbling players until you reach the end of the field and try to score a goal through a penalty.

Week 1 -> Introduction to syntax [C] (with the CS50 header working as a sort of training wheels)
mario.C -> Create two symetrical pyramids using "#" like those in the videogame Mario.
cash.c -> Using a greedy algorithm, determine the number and type of coins to give as change.
credit.c -> Check if a credit card number is valid and returns the correponding financial services company (VISA, AMEX, etc...).

Week 2 -> Introduction to arrays [C] (using CS50 header)
caesar.c -> Applies a ceaser cipher to a text, shifting the letters by the desired number of positions.
substitution.c -> Using an alphabet with a custom order, change all letters on a text using the new alphabet's positions.
readability.c -> Returns the recommended school grade to read a piece of text.

Week 3 -> Algorithms [C] (using CS50 header)
plurality.c -> Simple script, returning the winner in a plurality (who has most votes wins) election.
runoff.c -> Runoff election: Using voter preferences, eliminates the candidate with least votes sequentially returning the winner or winners.
tideman.c -> Tideman election: Using voter preferences, recursion and a graph search algorithm, check which candidate has the most votes without ever losing on a head-to-head. Successfully using recursion on this problem was particularly rewarding.

Week 4 -> Memory [C]
Lab 4: volume.c -> changes the volume of a .wav file by a relative ammount (5x, 0.5x, etc...)
Fitler: applies different filters (black and white, blur, reflection, edge detection) to a .bmp image. The logic in implementing the edge filter was particularly interesting
recovery.c -> recovers all deleted .JPEG files from a .raw disk

Week 5 -> Data Strutuctures [C]
Lab 5: Using pointers and recursion generate a family tree with blood type allele inheritance
Spell-Checker: Using a dictionary and provided texts, create a spell-checker using pointers and a custom hash table. Using pointers and having the Harvard staff's algorithm to compare performance-wise was fantastic. Hash table still needs to be improved in order to get better results.

Week 6 -> Python [Python]
Lab 6: Get estimated percentages of teams' chances of winning the Men's and Women's World Cups
Repeated several challenges previously done on C to notice the differences between both languages (hello.py, mario.py, credit.py, readability.py)
DNA: Created a script that checks a known database, and using RegEx on a DNA sequence, determine STR counts and identify who the DNA belongs to.

Week 7 -> SQL
Lab 7: Using some SQL queries, find out some data regarding the top 100 most played songs on Spotify
Movies: Using various SQL queries, obtain some data about various movies using IMDb's database
Fiftyville: Using various fake police databases, find out who stole CS50's mascot, where he went and who helped him, in fun game where several SQL queries unveiled various pieces of information crucial for this case.
